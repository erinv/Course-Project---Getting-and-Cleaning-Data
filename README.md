This repo pertains to the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

All the data processing and transformations are handled in a single script:
run_analysis.R.  

The run_analysis.R script returns a comma-delimited file: "project_summary.csv"

This summary file contains group averages by subject and activity of all the measurement variables, as specified in the assignment.  Descriptions of the variables in this file, as well as data processing and transformation steps taken, may be found in the markdown file:
CodeBook.md.
